# lockpick

This was something I worked on one afternoon to automatically buy lockpicks from a vendor in OSRS so I could go AFK and buy lockpicks. 

The bot switches worlds, keeps tracks of the worlds its visited, logs in automatically when it gets logged out and simulates "human" mouse movement.

Deciding to release it since it works, but it's highly prototyped and there was no focus on cleaning up the code whatsoever (just a workable prototype). I am by no means proud of the code, particularly the `Player` class which isn't even a class but a hacked-together mess so proceed with caution.
