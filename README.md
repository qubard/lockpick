# lockpick

This was something I worked on over 2-3 days to automatically buy lockpicks from a vendor in OSRS so I could go AFK and make money. 

The bot switches worlds, keeps tracks of the worlds its visited, logs in automatically when it gets logged out and simulates "human" mouse movement.

Deciding to release it since it's "educational".
